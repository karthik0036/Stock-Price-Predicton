Recurrent Neural Networks are the first of its kind State of the Art algorithms that can Memorize/remember previous inputs in memory, When a huge set of Sequential data is given to it.

These loops make recurrent neural networks seem kind of mysterious. However, if you think a bit more, it turns out that they aren’t all that different than a normal neural network. A recurrent neural network can be thought of as multiple copies of the same network, each passing a message to a successor.
The Problem of Long-Term Dependencies.

Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
Long Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies.
LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. Remembering information for long periods of time is practically their default behavior, not something they struggle to learn.



In this Project :
Breaking up of Data into chunks(60 Days), and training our model on this 60 days of Data ,
And making Prediction on 61st day and so on.
Data consists of Google’s stock price Data from oct 2004 to the present Day.
